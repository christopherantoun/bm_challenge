Customer (**customer_id**)\n2. Transaction Date (**transaction_date**) \n3. Payment Provider (**provider**)\n\nThe measure of the fact table is:\n\n1. Transaction Amount (**amount_eur**) \n\nThis would allow the data-analysts to create reports and predictions about the companies performance over selected time periods and per customer. The third dimension - payment provider - is needed since the transaction data is coming from two different payment providers. \n\nThe notebook should be triggered on a daily basis. This scheduling is dependent on the freshness interval of the payment data. Since payment data from Provider B is ingested on a daily basis, and this is the \"slowest\" of the two, the scheduling frequency of this notebook is set to be the same.",

      "source": "When data is not uniform across providers, it means that different providers have different data formats, structures, and quality levels for the same type of data. This can make it difficult to compare and analyze data from different providers because the data may not be directly comparable or may require significant preprocessing to make it comparable.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to compare sales data from two different retailers, one retailer may provide sales data in a format that includes more detailed information than the other retailerâ€™s sales data. This can make it difficult to compare the two datasets directly without first preprocessing the data to ensure that they are comparable.\n\nTo circumvent this, there are multiple things to be done. The simplest is to reduce the two datasets to the minimum dimensions and facts required. In this case: transaction_id (the id_hashed column created above), timestamp, customer_id, amount, currency, \n\nIf the two providers have different currency formats, that needs to be resolved. All currencies need to be converted to one currency (e.g. EURO) to allow aggregation / summation by the data analysts. To convert currencies, there are different methods and a decision on which method to choose needs to be a common decision by multiple stakeholders (data team, data / business analysts). One example would be to set up a dataset that ingests daily currency rates using a central bank API. Another would be to use that same dataset to use an average monthly conversion rate.\n\nFor the purpose of this challenge, I'll assume that the data from provider A contains a currency column and an amount column (i.e. the amount is given in local currency). The transformation would be to convert this into a uniform currency (EURO) based on a conversion rate given in the table (average conversion rate corresponding to the month the transaction took place in). The other dataset from Provider B already contains the amounts in EUROs. ",

This is to allow joining with the customer table in the internal Postgres database later on. For this example, assume that the Crypto.Cipher module is used to decrypt the values in the specified column using the AES algorithm.
